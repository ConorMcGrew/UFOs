# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In order to make Dana's data even more interactable, we have added filters for city, state, country, and shape in addition to the date of the sightings. 

## Results
Users have the option of using only one filter at a time or multiple filters. 

Using a single filter, a user could search for only sightings that occurred on 1/12/2010, for instance, by typing "1/12/2010" into the date filter and pressing enter.

Or a user could filter for sightings that occurred in the state of California, by typing "ca" into the state filter and pressing enter.

Users can also apply two or more filters at the same time by entering each into its respective field.

Note that as you enter each filter criteria, the table does not auto filter (so if you are applying more than one filter, you need to press enter after each if you want to do one after another, or enter all filters first then press enter). Moreover, the dates must be entered in M/DD/YEAR format, states must be entered as two letter lowercase abbreviations, and shapes and cities must be entered in lowercase. 

## Summary
A potential drawback is that users may be tempted to enter all search criteria first before pressing enter, and no results are returned. Two suggestions: first, apply entered filters automatically so that people can see the results in real-time. Second, if no results are returned from the filter, have a "no results found" come up.
